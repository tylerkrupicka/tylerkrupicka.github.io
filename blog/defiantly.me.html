    <p>After the @DefiantLee_ twitter bot had its API key taken away, I decided to create a Django web app to utilize my machine learning classifier. The site is hosted on digitalocean, and uses the twitter api to display and store recent misuses. <br /><br /><a href="http://defiantly.me">defiantly.me</a></p><!-- more --><h2>Django</h2><p>I'm using Django 1.7, python 2.7, tweepy, and nltk to operate the website. The site polls for tweets every time the page is loaded, and saves new tweets to the sqlite database. I originally had a lot of difficulty setting up the Naive Bayes classifier to initialize when the site started, because Django doesn't really have a good system for that. I only want to initialize the classifier (which is loading thousands of tweets) once when the site starts, because creating a new one per request would take an insane amount of time and resources. I ended up creating the classifier in the Django settings.py file, which is only run once.</p><h2>Gunicorn / Nginx</h2><p><a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a> uses Gunicorn and Nginx to operate Django applications on their servers. Gunicorn automatically creates multiple instances of the Django app, so that it can easily handle multiple requests to the site. Learning some of the configurations for these utilities, as well as modifying file permissions, took some time.</p><h2>Twitter Widgets</h2><p>While twitter has an api for creating embedded tweets, as I was reading the documentation I noticed they had restrictions on usage and volume. I decided to avoid authentication and twitter errors entirely, and just use their "static" embed widget html (the embed code they give you when you click embed on a tweet). This seemed to work fine, although it's not very fast loading.</p><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/joeykidney">@joeykidney</a> and u will defiantly each that</p>&mdash; Kaycee Leigh (@kayceesmall2016) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayceesmall2016/status/550741149422747648">January 1, 2015</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
