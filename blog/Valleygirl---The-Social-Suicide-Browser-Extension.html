    <p>Jimmy and I have been hard at work creating "ValleyGirl", a Javascript browser extension that clicks every Facebook like button across the web. We're sorry.<br><br><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/valley-girl-like-everythi/aaobhafeeoijpgnohafhbpjldeoldpin?hl=en">Chrome Webstore</a></p><!-- more --><img id="postimg" src="../assets/valleygirl/cover.png" alt="logo"><h2>The Idea</h2><p>I don't exactly remember the circumstances that led to us coming up with the idea for ValleyGirl, but it definitely wasn't a legitimate use.</p><p>In general good pranks involve embarrassing someone in front of their friends, which makes Facebook an obvious platform choice. Liking things is usually pretty subtle, but I think Facebook is something people like to keep highly curated regardless. It becomes more and more apparent that something is up when your friend's feeds are full of your activity.</p><h2>Development and Functionality</h2><p>ValleyGirl was written over a weekend in Javascript, and heavily relies on Jquery for modifying and interacting with webpages. By deleting the "browser_action" field in the Chrome manifest, we can even hide the extension icon in the browser toolbar.</p><p>For external sites, we take advantage of the fact that extensions can load in to iframes, which allows them to click the usually unreachable Facebook Like buttons. On these sites we found hiding the button after clicking to be the best way to not alert the user.</p><p>On Facebook we created a function that will find each un-clicked like button on the page and click it, meanwhile adding a hidden attribute so that we don't click it twice. After clicking we have to make a huge amount of changes to make everything look normal:  changing the color of the button back, removing the word "you", correcting the grammar of the user list, decrementing the counter, and changing the word "unlike" in the comments to "like". This function runs on page load as well as during scrolling, ensuring that it likes everything you see on the site.</p><h2>Betas</h2><p>Jimmy and I accidentally tested the extension on our accounts while developing, and were surprised how difficult it was to tell. However, for a more robust test we decided to install it on our friend Adam's computer and see if it could fool him. For two days he liked all of the posts and comments on his feed, as well as a bunch of recipes from an external site. <br><br>Many thanks to him for not beating us up. We're terribly sorry.</p><img id="postimg" src="../assets/valleygirl/facebook.png" alt="logo">
