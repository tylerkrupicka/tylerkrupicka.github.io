Title: New Design and New Generator

<p>
This site no longer uses Octopress/Jekyll; I decided to create my own site design and generator (written in Python). The site generator is called <a href="https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/staticky">Staticky</a> and fixes a lot of the issues I had with Octopress. This includes giving me full control of designing the site in HTML and CSS.

	After a month of using Octopress, I begin to realize just how complicated it was only for the task of assembling my site. I wanted to be able to create a simple site layout and stylesheet and have the generator add posts and fill variables; not have so many files and directories that it was difficult to find styling for site elements.

	My new site has the appearance and simplicity I was originally looking for, and I'm excited to continue development of it.
