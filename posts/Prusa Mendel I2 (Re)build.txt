Title: Prusa Mendel I2 (Re)build

<p>
	This spring I purchased a partially completed Prusa Mendel i2 hobby 3D printer from another student at RIT. On initial inspection the printer looked fully assembled, but didn't have the correct software. In all actuality, there was still quite a bit to fix before it would be ready to print.

<h2>Software Fixes</h2>
<p>
	The printer itself was an (almost) complete kit that was technically assembled, but very poorly. I initially focused on getting functioning firmware on the printer and checking that the wiring was fine. You can find my fork of the open source Sprinter firmware <a href='https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/Sprinter'>here</a>. The printer uses the Sanguinololu 1.2 board and Pololu motor drivers to run each of the steppers. Luckily, all of the motors worked when I configured the firmware so I could focus on the hardware.
</p>

<h2>Hardware Fixes</h2>
<p>
	The printer had a few notable issues: it was missing a print bed, the carriage was actually a cheap photo frame (seriously), and the previous owner had thought it was a good idea to hot glue the heating element in. Here's a photo of the hot glued extruder mount.

<p>
I fixed the issues with the glue in the extruder by designing and printing a bracket for the J-head extruder on a lab 3D printer. The bracket tightly holds the hot end in place vertically; it had previously just flopped around and fallen out when the hot end was heated. Which is why you don't hold something hot with hot glue.

	After fixing the x-axis and installing the bracket I noticed that the carriage for the y-axis was held together by hot glue as well. On closer inspection, I realized that the carriage was actually a cheap picture frame held together by glue and a few staples.

<p>
	With some help and suggestions from friends working in the lab, I ended up laser cutting a particle board replacement for the photo frame. It turned out pretty well, but somehow I accidentally scaled it down while cutting so the holes for mounting the heated bed are too close to the edge.

<p>
	I also needed to put a print surface over the heated bed on the printer. A friend in the lab introduced me to Garolite, a type of plastic that sticks to ABS well, and found a piece that I could use. I used a vertical band saw to cut it to size and then drilled holes for the mount. Additionally, I got some springs to fit underneath the bed so it can be easily leveled.

<h2>Calibration</h2>
<p>
	After completing all of the crucial hardware fixes, I was able to spend some time zeroing the printer and doing calibration prints. I found that my timing belt on the y-axis was too angled at the ends, so I made some new timing belt clamps and a friend made a new pulley.

	I then worked on correcting the scale of the prints, making sure each axis was moving correct distances. This took some time but eventually they moved set distances reliably. Unfortunately, I was only able to do a few short calibration prints after that before having to store the printer for the summer. I'll have the opportunity to test out some larger prints when I return to school in August.
</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>
	I would never have been able to complete so much work on the printer without the help and resources of a lot of people in the lab at RIT. They helped me out even when I wasn't confident that I could fix any part of it, and that was exactly what I needed.
