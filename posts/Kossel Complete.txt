    After months of transporting the kossel and dealing with broken components I was finally able to get it fully assembled and functional.

<h2>Broken Plastic</h2>
<p>
    After three flights across the country the printer had some broken pieces from the airlines baggage claim. I was able to purchase some replacement acrylic pieces from Blue Eagle Labs site to fix a broken extruder mount, slide mount, and carriage.

<h2>Broken Electronics</h2>
<p>
    When I was calibrating the printer in the spring I was getting erratic behavior out of the extruder stepper motor. It would hum and click but often not perform full rotations, which       was difficult to diagnose. I tried a lot of adjustments with the Pololu stepper motor driver trim pot but that didn't seem to have any effect.

    When I got to San Diego I swapped the motor driver with a spare from the Prusa and everything worked out of the box. After a little calibration of the trim pot the extruder has become extremely reliable.

<h2>Calibration</h2>
<p>
    I've found the calibration probe that operates on the G28 command of the marlin firmware to be unreliable. So far I've had issues with the probe tolerances causing the print head ot make contact first. Manual calibration can be time consuming, but is only necessary very infrequently and is quite reliable.

<p>
    For delta printers, calibration requires calibrating the height in the center of the bed as well as at each of the edges. For the Kossel Clear this requires sequentially calibrating each of them until a balance is found. Using Pronterface I created buttons that move the print head to each of the axis home positions to make the process easier.

<h2>Surfaces</h2>
<p>
    Painters tape makes a reliable print surface for PLA printers but laying out strips causes ridges and issues. I looked in to purchasing a larger sheet online before discovering that   Fry's Electronics carries them. Ten dollars for double wide sheets is a great deal.
