  The defiantly.me website has finally reached the 25,000 saved misuses mark--signaling the appropriate time to end the project and clean up. Additionally, the server has been having some cpu issues recently that caused some downtime.

<h2>100% CPU</h2>
<p>
  For reasons I don't entirely understand, the server started locking up and holding 100% CPU usage in April. While this was a very low power Digital Ocean droplet, it usually maxed out at around 10% in previous months. <br / ><br />Even more confusing, it only reached about 20% CPU usage while recieving over 600 requests from a reddit post. When the server locked up, ssh was no longer possible so I wasn't able to do much diagnosis either. I've posted the usage graphs above to illustrate the strain (all of the drops are due to restarts while I try to diagnose).

  In order to preserve the final state of the site I have made the top ~50 tweets available at <a href = "http://tylerkrupicka.com/defiantly.html">/defiantly.</a>
