Title: Getting Started: About This Site

<p>The last few weeks I've been working on developing this website as a place to post projects and thoughts as well as get more experience with web development. It's finally at a point where I'm content with the styling and layout (for the moment) so I thought it would be good to post some of what I've learned so far.</p>

<p>When I originally planned on developing a site a year ago, I was daunted with the task of creating one from scratch. I didn't want to use a pre-built platform, because you lose a lot of control of the site and can't learn anything from it. This site is generated by <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, a static site generator that adds features to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Websites built using Octopress/Jekyll are generated locally, meaning that the site is assembled each time a change is made. This avoids the problem of having to work with databases and allows me to have full control over the appearance of the site.</p>
<p>Another bonus to having a static site is the ability to use git for version control and Github Pages for free hosting. Each time I want to update the site, I commit the most recent changes to the site's repository on Github and the site is hosted from there. This system makes it really easy to maintain the site and keeps the cost of running it down. Additionally, I can still use my own domain name when accessing the site.</p>
<p>In summary, Octopress makes creating a static site really simple, while holding on to the customization that I want. Nice!</p>
