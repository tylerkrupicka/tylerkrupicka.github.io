I've always wanted a way to easily create moving timelapses without a super expensive fixed axis rig. Over the last month I've finally created a (fairly) reliable system using a Brio train set and Thomas the Tank Engine toy train from the 90's. Everyone has a box of these somewhere in the attic.<br><br>

<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>
The Brio train track set provides a simple way to create a moving path, and continues to be a common and cheap set of toys. The puzzle piece style track allows for a whole variety of different courses as well. For me, I was hoping to be able to take revolving timelapses of my Kossel 3D printer, which I'll be posting sometime soon.

<h2>Rewiring Thomas</h2>
<p>
The main issue with using the Brio motorized trains is the speed at which they move. In order to get a seamless timelapse, we need the train to only move a foot over the course of almost 10 minutes. This can be achieved a few ways: lowering the provided voltage; using PWM to quickly turn the motors on and off; and making the train move in short bursts. After some initial testing it became apparent that the motor barely had enough torque to pull the Gopro, so bursts were the only option.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to create the burst timing was with an Arduino Uno and a Mosfet transistor to enable/disable the flow of current from the AA power source. I cut the wires on the negative end of the circuit and added some extension wires for attaching the Mosfet.

<h2>The Mount</h2>
<p>
In order to mount a Gopro on a Brio train car, I needed to create a bracket that would fit in the car's cargo slot and also elevate the camera enough to see the print bed. I modeled the mount in inventor, printed it, and then fastened it to the train car with a dot of hot glue.

<h2>First Run</h2>
<p>
I bought a small Brio "logging car" to store the Arduino and its 9V battery while taking a timelapse, and filmed a 5-second interval timelapse. The print (a Nexus 7 outlet mount) took a couple hours, so I was able to get a lot of footage. Unfortunately, Thomas did not have enough torque to pull the cars, which caused him to get stuck when he encountered any resistance on the corners. The resulting timelapse had long pauses as I manually got him unstuck -- often to just get stuck again.

<h2>Third Volt's a Charm</h2>
<p>
I purchased a cheap 3V AA battery pack to effectively double the input voltage to the train; I noticed that it used a common toy motor that can operate with up to 4.5V. This significantly improved the torque output of the system, allowing for a much more consistent pulse width and virtually no issues with resistance.

<h2>Going Forward</h2>
<p>
I've gotten some good timelapse videos following the addition of the 3V battery pack, and I'm working on making a super cut to show what it can do. Additionally, I'm going to keep trying to improve the reliability, as well as look into printing a much better train car specifically for timelapses.
