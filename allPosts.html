    <h2><a href="blog/Defiant Lee A Twitter Bot that Learns.html">Defiant Lee: A Twitter Bot that Learns</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2014-09-27</div>
    <p>In the last week a friend pointed out how common it is for people to mistype "definitely" as "defiantly" on twitter, often because of autocorrect. I decided to try using the tweepy twitter library for python to create a twitter bot that responds to people when they make the mistake.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Defiant Lee A Twitter Bot that Learns.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Building a Kossel Clear.html">Building a Kossel Clear</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2014-09-24</div>
    <p>Over the summer I bought a  set of parts to build a delta configuration Kossel 3D printer with an acrylic frame from Blue Eagle Labs. The kit uses over the shelf slides and bearings and the Ramps 1.4 shield for the Arduino Mega, to create a easily modifiable printer with an impressive print volume.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Building a Kossel Clear.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Staticky My Static Site Generator.html">Staticky: My Static Site Generator</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2014-08-02</div>
    <p>These last few weeks I went through a full site re-design, in the process making my own site generator called <a href="https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/staticky">Staticky</a> to propagate all the new site layouts. I wanted it to have all of the core features of Jekyll/Octopress, but make creating a site and customization much easier.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Staticky My Static Site Generator.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/New Design and New Generator.html">New Design and New Generator</a></h2>

    <p>This site no longer uses Octopress/Jekyll; I decided to create my own site design and generator (written in Python). The site generator is called <a href="https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/staticky">Staticky</a> and fixes a lot of the issues I had with Octopress. This includes giving me full control of designing the site in HTML and CSS.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/New Design and New Generator.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Prusa Mendel I2 (Re)build.html">Prusa Mendel I2 (Re)build</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2014-07-10</div>
    <p>This spring I purchased a partially completed Prusa Mendel i2 hobby 3D printer from another student at RIT. On initial inspection the printer looked fully assembled, but didn't have the correct software. In all actuality, there was still quite a bit to fix before it would be ready to print.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Prusa Mendel I2 (Re)build.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Fixing the Samsung Galaxy.html">Fixing the Samsung Galaxy</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2014-07-02</div>
    <p>I've had a Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone for a year now and it's a good phone. However, the software that Samsung has put on top of stock android can be really awful in places and I've spent lots of time finding fixes. My phone runs the stock KitKat launcher, uses stock Google service apps, does all of its media from Google Play, and uses the stock Google camera app. These apps not only look much better visually, but provide a much better service than anything Samsung produces. Here's how to set up these fixes on any device running Android KitKat or newer.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Fixing the Samsung Galaxy.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Artificial Intelligence for Gobble.html">Artificial Intelligence for Gobblet</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2014-06-24</div>
    <p>Recently I had the opportunity to design an AI to play the board game "Gobblet" for a team-based class project. At the end of the project all of the AIs entered in to a tournament against each other to determine which strategies were the most effective. My team's AI ended up making it to the department finals; performing well against a variety of Gobblet strategies. Here I'm going to explain the basis of how our AI player was designed.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Artificial Intelligence for Gobble.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Getting Started About This Site.html">Getting Started: About This Site</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2014-06-21</div>
    <p>The last few weeks I've been working on developing this website as a place to post projects and thoughts as well as get more experience with web development. It's finally at a point where I'm content with the styling and layout (for the moment) so I thought it would be good to post some of what I've learned so far.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Getting Started About This Site.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br />
