    <p>As part of my Digital Systems Design II course, I completed an optional assignment implementing algorithms for automating some digital design tasks. The first program algorithmically solves state transition tables when designing state machine circuits. The second generates a minimized set of test vectors for a circuit using path sensitization.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Algorithms-for-Digital-Systems.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Parrot-AR-Drone-2-Challenge.html">Parrot AR Drone 2 Challenge</a></h2>
    <div id="date">written 2015-05-16</div>
    <p>I recently competed in a team autonomous drone challenge for the "RIT Meets the Jetsons" event during Imagine RIT. The team placed second, using the Parrot AR Drone 2 camera to autonomously recognize Jetsons characters and perform aerial maneuvers. We placed second overall in the event--winning one of RIT President Destler's 125 year old antique banjos.</p><p><a href = "https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/ARChallenge">On Github</a></p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Parrot-AR-Drone-2-Challenge.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Defiantly-Done.html">Defiantly Done</a></h2>

    <p>The defiantly.me website has finally reached the 25,000 saved misuses mark--signaling the appropriate time to end the project and clean up. Additionally, the server has been having some cpu issues recently that caused some downtime.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Defiantly-Done.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/To-San-Diego.html">To San Diego</a></h2>

    <p>It's official. This summer and fall I will be on co-op as a software engineer for Intuit Inc. in San Diego. I've been assigned a department within the TurboTax division, and I'm really looking forward to joining the team.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/To-San-Diego.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/defiantly.me.html">defiantly.me</a></h2>

    <p>After the @DefiantLee_ twitter bot had its API key taken away, I decided to create a Django web app to utilize my machine learning classifier. The site is hosted on digitalocean, and uses the twitter api to display and store recent misuses. <br /><br /><a href="http://defiantly.me">defiantly.me</a></p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/defiantly.me.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Staticky-Version-2.html">Staticky Version 2</a></h2>

    <p>Today I made some major updates to the staticky site generator that my site runs on, to allow for a wide variety of sites to be created with it. Previously, the generator was tailored to providing only the functionality that this site needed, without allowing much creativity in site layout.<p><a href="https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/staticky">On Github</a></p></p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Staticky-Version-2.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Defiant-Lee-A-Naive-Bayes-Twitter-Bot.html">Defiant Lee: A Naive Bayes Twitter Bot</a></h2>

    <p>In the last week a friend pointed out how common it is for people to mistype "definitely" as "defiantly" on twitter, often because of autocorrect. I decided to try using the tweepy twitter library for python to create a twitter bot that responds to people when they make the mistake.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/DefiantLee">On Github</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiantLee_/with_replies">Twitter</a></p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Defiant-Lee-A-Naive-Bayes-Twitter-Bot.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Building-a-Kossel-Clear.html">Building a Kossel Clear</a></h2>

    <p>Over the summer I bought a  set of parts to build a delta configuration Kossel 3D printer with an acrylic frame from Blue Eagle Labs. The kit uses over the shelf slides and bearings and the Ramps 1.4 shield for the Arduino Mega, to create a easily modifiable printer with an impressive print volume.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Building-a-Kossel-Clear.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Staticky-My-Static-Site-Generator.html">Staticky: My Static Site Generator</a></h2>

    <p>These last few weeks I went through a full site re-design, in the process making my own site generator called <a href="https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/staticky">Staticky</a> to propagate all the new site layouts. I wanted it to have all of the core features of Jekyll/Octopress, but make creating a site and customization much easier.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Staticky-My-Static-Site-Generator.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/New-Design-and-New-Generator.html">New Design and New Generator</a></h2>

    <p>This site no longer uses Octopress/Jekyll; I decided to create my own site design and generator (written in Python). The site generator is called <a href="https://github.com/tylerkrupicka/staticky">Staticky</a> and fixes a lot of the issues I had with Octopress. This includes giving me full control of designing the site in HTML and CSS.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/New-Design-and-New-Generator.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Prusa-Mendel-I2-(Re)build.html">Prusa Mendel I2 (Re)build</a></h2>

    <p>This spring I purchased a partially completed Prusa Mendel i2 hobby 3D printer from another student at RIT. On initial inspection the printer looked fully assembled, but didn't have the correct software. In all actuality, there was still quite a bit to fix before it would be ready to print.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Prusa-Mendel-I2-(Re)build.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Gobblet.html">Artificial Intelligence for Gobblet</a></h2>

    <p>Recently I had the opportunity to design an AI to play the board game "Gobblet" for a team-based class project. At the end of the project all of the AIs entered in to a tournament against each other to determine which strategies were the most effective. My team's AI ended up making it to the department finals; performing well against a variety of Gobblet strategies. Here I'm going to explain the basis of how our AI player was designed.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Gobblet.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br /><h2><a href="blog/Getting-Started-About-This-Site.html">Getting Started: About This Site</a></h2>

    <p>The last few weeks I've been working on developing this website as a place to post projects and thoughts as well as get more experience with web development. It's finally at a point where I'm content with the styling and layout (for the moment) so I thought it would be good to post some of what I've learned so far.</p> <div id="readon"><a href="blog/Getting-Started-About-This-Site.html">Read on &rarr;</a></div><br /><br />
